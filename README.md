# Premier League Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that form an end-to-end workflow for analyzing Premier League football data:

1. **Scraping Premier League Data:**  
   This notebook demonstrates how to use Python's `requests` library along with Beautiful Soup to scrape up-to-date match statistics and related data from websites. The scraped data can then be saved locally for analysis.

2. **Match Prediction using Random Forest:**  
   Using the data obtained from the scraping process, this notebook employs machine learning techniques (with a Random Forest classifier) to predict match results. The notebook includes steps for data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Overview

The aim of this project is twofold:
- **Data Collection:** Automate the extraction of Premier League data using web scraping techniques.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Leverage machine learning to forecast match outcomes, helping to better understand the factors that influence game results.

This exploratory project not only showcases your ability to gather and process real-world data but also demonstrates how predictive models can be applied in sports analytics.

## Project Components

- **`notebooks/Scraping_Premier_League_Data.ipynb`:**  
  Demonstrates how to scrape Premier League data with Beautiful Soup. It walks through sending HTTP requests, parsing HTML content, and extracting pertinent information.

- **`notebooks/Match_Prediction_RandomForest.ipynb`:**  
  Provides an end-to-end machine learning pipeline. It covers how to clean and preprocess the data, engineer features, train a Random Forest model, evaluate its performance, and predict match results.

- **`requirements.txt`:**  
  Lists all required Python packages to run the notebooks in a reproducible environment.
